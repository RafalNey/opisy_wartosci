In Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, self-direction of action is part of the broader 'Self-Direction' category, highlighting independent thought, creativity, and the exploration of new ideas (Schwartz, 1992). This value also resonates with Deci and Ryan's Self-Determination Theory (SDT), on three core needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness, which are essential for psychological growth and well-being (Ryan & Deci, 2000).

Autonomy and self-direction of action are key components of SDT, which emphasizes the importance of feeling in control of one's decisions and choices.

Embracing self-directed action helps individuals assert their autonomy, enhance their skills, and build meaningful relationships, all of which contribute to psychological well-being and personal growth. Thus, self-direction is more than a personal preference it's a pathway to living a more empowered, fulfilled, and connected life.
